## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- filter (change the color of SVG file)
- class combination

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.



```css
.icon:hover{
  filter:invert(66%) sepia(18%) saturate(1535%) hue-rotate(122deg) brightness(90%) contrast(89%);} 
/* it changes the color of SVG file */
```
```js

```

### Continued development

the readability of CSS. Eventhoght i used custom properties and combination of classes, but it sill look not readable enough. 
A new way on using CSS and HTML. I need more easier advance ways to use CSS and HTML other than what i am doing now (flex, grid, margin etc) to make a better webpage

### Useful resources

- (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22252472/how-to-change-the-color-of-an-svg-element) - This helped me to change the color of SVG by adding filter on it.
